# summary

this package implements a web frontend to hgfs, the mercurial file system.
html pages are generated for the various views on mercurial repositories.

the following pages are provided:

- last commit message for each repository
- links to often used files/information for a given repository, such man
  pages it contains, .b & .m files, the latest .tgz, command to clone the
  repository, etc.
- rss feed of the previous two views
- diff between any two revisions of a given repository
- the man2html-formatted manual page of a given unprocessed man page in
  a given repository, for a given file
- last n commit messages for a given repository, in short or long format


# download

the homepage of this software is at

	http://www.ueber.net/repo/r/hgweb

on that page, commands to clone the repository can be found, and a link
to the latest .tgz.


# install

make sure the packages "web" (see http://www.ueber.net/repo/r/web) and
"scgid" (see http://www.ueber.net/repo/r/scgid) are installed.

first make a file "mkconfig" similar to your inferno's installation
mkconfig (symlink/bind it).  now type "mk" and then "mk install" to
compile and install.  next, install the files in /lib into your inferno
installation.


# run

running this can become quite complicated.  first of all, hgweb needs
to be started by scgid, see its documentation for usage information.
second, hgweb assumes /n/hg holds all repositories.  multiple hg/fs'en can
easily be exported by styxlisten, and mounted using "mount -P", allowing
you to restart the hg/fs'en+styxlisten without restarting the scgid.

hgweb also links (on the webserver) to files named "../hg/$repository".
the links in /lib/template/hgweb/* may have to be changed.  also, files
in that directory contain instructions specific to my own installation,
so be sure to look through them.

# todo
- add a view that, given a repo+path, lists the revisions the file was
  changed in.  one revision can have its changelog shown in full.
- generate correct diffs, needs an "ndiff" that "patches one-way absent
  files into/out of existence".
- for html of generated man pages, remove links to man & section index.
- turn README's of repo into html by using something akin to markdown?
  providing just a link to the README makes user have to click once more...
